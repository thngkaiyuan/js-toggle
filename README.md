# js-toggle

A Chrome extension to help you toggle the Javascript setting (allow/block) on any page with ease.

## Why do you need js-toggle?

I disable Javascript on a number of pages. Things are snappier, you don't get annoying pop-ups and you protect yourself from Javascript exploits (more reasons [here](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/26179/why-do-people-disable-javascript)).

If you're like me, then you will be hoping for an easier way to allow/block Javascript on pages. *js-toggle* is precisely the solution to that problem. With `Ctrl` + `I` (Windows) or `âŒ˜ Cmd` + `J` (Mac), you can easily toggle Javascript to be allowed/blocked on pages. Clicking on the extension icon works too! Here's *js-toggle* in action:
